### GraphQL Query Costs & Rate Limits

- **Product Creation**: 10 cost points
- **Product Update**: 10 cost points
- **Product Deletion**: 10 cost points
- **Product Query**: 1 cost point per product

Shopify's GraphQL Admin API uses **calculated query cost** rate limiting with a **leaky bucket algorithm**. The leak rates are:

- **Standard Shopify**: 100 points/second
- **Advanced Shopify**: 200 points/second
- **Shopify Plus**: 1000 points/second
- **Shopify for Enterprise**: 2000 points/second

This means you can theoretically:

- **Standard Shopify**: Create/update/delete up to 10 products per second (100 points √∑ 10 points per operation)
- **Shopify Plus**: Create/update/delete up to 100 products per second (1000 points √∑ 10 points per operation)
- **Query operations**: Much higher throughput since queries cost only 1 point per product

### How Calculated Query Points Work

Shopify's GraphQL Admin API uses a sophisticated cost calculation system:

- **Scalar/Enum fields**: 0 points (free)
- **Object fields**: 1 point each
- **Interface/Union fields**: Maximum cost of possible selections
- **Connection fields**: Sized by first/last arguments
- **Mutations**: 10 points (fixed cost)

The cost is calculated based on the **requested** fields, not the actual data returned. This means:

- Simple queries cost less and allow higher throughput
- Complex queries with many fields cost more
- You can optimize by selecting only the fields you need

Shopify uses a **leaky bucket algorithm** where:

- Each **app-store combination** has a bucket with capacity based on your plan
- Points are **consumed** when making requests (mutations cost 10 points, queries cost 1+ points)
- Points are **restored continuously** at a fixed rate per second (the "leak rate")
- This allows for **bursts of activity** while maintaining fair usage across all apps
- **No waiting periods** - points are restored in real-time, not reset at intervals

### High-Volume Operations

With the correct rate limits, here are more accurate time estimates:

**Standard Shopify (100 points/second):**

- **1,000 Products**: ~100 seconds (1.7 minutes)
- **100,000 Products**: ~1,000 seconds (16.7 minutes)
- **1,000,000 Products**: ~10,000 seconds (2.8 hours)

**Shopify Plus (1000 points/second):**

- **1,000 Products**: ~10 seconds
- **100,000 Products**: ~100 seconds (1.7 minutes)
- **1,000,000 Products**: ~1,000 seconds (16.7 minutes)

_Note: These are theoretical minimums. Actual times may be longer due to network latency, Shopify processing time, and the need to implement delays to avoid overwhelming the API._

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend

- **HTML**: Clean, semantic markup with GraphQL-specific sections
- **CSS**: Modern, responsive design with rate limit cards and query tabs
- **JavaScript**: ES6+ with async/await for GraphQL API calls

### Backend

- **Express.js**: RESTful API endpoints
- **GraphQL Client**: GraphQL-request for Shopify API calls
- **Faker.js**: Random data generation
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/benchmark/create` - Test GraphQL product creation
- `POST /api/benchmark/update` - Test GraphQL product updates
- `POST /api/benchmark/delete` - Test GraphQL product deletion
- `POST /api/rate-limit-analysis` - Analyze store's rate limits
- `POST /api/store-credentials` - Store credentials securely
- `GET /api/stored-credentials/:sessionId` - Retrieve stored credentials
- `GET /api/health` - Health check with GraphQL info

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)

### Customization

You can modify these values in `server.js`:

- Number of products to create/update/delete (up to 1,000,000)
- Delay between API calls
- Rate limit thresholds
- GraphQL query structures

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Rate Limit Detection Issues

**Why doesn't the app show my updated rate limits?**

The app detects rate limits from your actual API responses, not from your Shopify plan settings. If you've upgraded your plan but don't see the new limits:

1. **Check your app's access scopes** - ensure your app has the necessary permissions
2. **Verify the API client** - rate limits are per app-store combination, not global
3. **Wait for propagation** - plan changes may take time to propagate to the API
4. **Check response headers** - the app looks for rate limit info in GraphQL response extensions
5. **Use the cost debug header** - add `Shopify-GraphQL-Cost-Debug=1` to see detailed cost information

**Pro Tip**: The app now extracts rate limit information from both HTTP headers AND GraphQL response extensions for more accurate detection.

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing store URL or access token"**

   - Ensure both fields are filled
   - Check URL format (must include `https://`)

2. **"Unauthorized" errors**

   - Verify your access token is correct
   - Check if token has required permissions
   - Ensure token hasn't expired

3. **Rate limit errors**

   - The tool should handle this automatically
   - If persistent, wait a few minutes and try again

4. **GraphQL errors**

   - Check if your store supports GraphQL Admin API
   - Ensure you're using the correct API version (2023-10)

5. **High-volume operation timeouts**
   - Large operations may take hours or days
   - Use the progress tracking to monitor status
   - Consider running smaller batches first

### Debug Mode

Check the browser console and server logs for detailed error information.

## üìà Understanding Results

### Response Time

- Lower is better
- Includes network latency and Shopify processing time
- Measured in seconds

### Rate Limit

- Shows current API usage: `current/limit`
- Example: `45/1000` means 45 cost points used out of 1000 limit

### Query Cost

- Each operation has a specific cost in points
- Lower cost = more operations possible per minute
- Total cost shows cumulative usage

### Products Per Second

- Calculated based on response time and cost
- Theoretical maximum based on Shopify's rate limits
- Helps understand your store's performance ceiling

### Performance Projections

- **Time Estimates**: How long larger operations would take
- **Cost Estimates**: Total API cost for large operations
- **Scalability**: How your store performs under load

### Status

- **Completed**: Operation successful
- **Failed**: Operation failed (check details)
- **Pending**: Operation not yet started
